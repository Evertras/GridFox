        <blockquote>
            Hi.  I'm Brandon Fulljames.  I'm a programmer that works on
            enterprise-level back end web applications.  I embarass myself with
            trying to oil paint on the side.  You can reach me at
            <a href="mailto:bfullj@gmail.com">bfullj@gmail.com</a>

        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            I wanted to put a grid over reference photos and discovered that this is
            actually a lot harder to do with existing tools than I thought.  Being
            a programmer means you can just make this stuff.  So I did!  I used this
            as an opportunity to learn more AngularJS along with fancy new HTML5
            features, so it's a win/win as it's keeping my skills sharp and improves
            my front end development, which is a little rusty.

        <h2>Why did I share this?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            I like making stuff that other people can use.  It makes me really happy
            seeing people get use out of this!  I also really appreciate feedback
            and criticism to improve, as this is related to my job and doing this
            as a side project helps make me better at my job.

        <h2>Where do my images go?  How does this work?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Nowhere.  Nothing is uploaded to the server.  I can't see what you're
            importing because it's never sent anywhere.  It's all local in your
            browser!  I do this mostly for privacy concerns, and partially because
            images flying all over the internet can start eating up bandwidth that
            isn't necessary to use.  It's a win for everyone.  Everything is saved
            locally as well, so you should be able to pick up right where you left
            off if you close your browser.  Just remember it won't transfer to
            another device!

        <h2>How does the height and width work?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            You probably noticed that there's no 'inches' or 'centimeters' with the
            height and width.  This is because these are just ratios to help size
            the canvas.  If you have a canvas that's 18" by 24", for example, just put
            in 18 and 24.  If it's 30 centimeters by 30 centimeters, just put in 30
            and 30.  Since the canvas has to resize itself to fit the page anyway,
            there's no point in using specific units.  It's only to figure out the aspect
            ratio and help plan out your piece.

        <h2>What's the 'phi' grid?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Phi is a grid based on the golden ratio and is thought to be more pleasing
            to the eye than the more general 'rule of thirds' in some cases.  Play
            around with it and make your own judgements with your compositions.

        <h2>Does this work for tablets?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            You know what would be great?  Being able to upload your images from
            your smart phone or tablet and doing stuff from there.  You know what
            would be even more awesome?  If this actually worked right now.  I'm
            looking into it, but in the meantime there are a fair amount of native apps
            out there for iOS and Android that might work better for you.  This is
            mainly targeted to desktop/laptop users for now.

        <h2>Who pays for the hosting?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            I do.  It's not an inconsequential amount, so if anyone ever offers to
            buy me a Coke Zero through Paypal I certainly wouldn't say no.  But I don't plan on
            putting any ads up or any 'Donate' style buttons for the moment.  If
            for some reason this starts getting thousands of hits a day I might have
            to in order to cover costs, just as a warning.

            More information means I can fix it more easily.

        <h2>I have a really cool idea, can you make it do X?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Maybe!  I'm definitely open to ideas.  I do want to keep things
            relatively clean and simple.  I don't want the page to fill up
            much more than it is already, and I want every tool to be simple
            and clear in its use.  Layers, for example, are too complicated
            for this.  Something like a color palette, though, is something
            I'll be looking into.
